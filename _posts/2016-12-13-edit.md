### Built exclusively for Markdown ###

Enjoy first-class Markdown support with easy access to  Markdown syntax and convenient keyboard shortcuts.

Give them a try:

- **Bold** (`Ctrl+B`) and *Italic* (`Ctrl+I`)
- Quotes (`Ctrl+Q`)
- Code blocks (`Ctrl+K`)
- Headings 1, 2, 3 (`Ctrl+1`, `Ctrl+2`, `Ctrl+3`)
- Lists (`Ctrl+U` and `Ctrl+Shift+O`)

### See your changes instantly with LivePreview ###

Don't guess if your [hyperlink syntax](http://markdownpad.com) is correct; LivePreview will show you exactly what your document looks like every time you press a key.

### Make it your own ###

Fonts, color schemes, layouts and stylesheets are all 100% customizable so you can turn MarkdownPad into your perfect editor.

### A robust editor for advanced Markdown users ###

MarkdownPad supports multiple Markdown processing engines, including standard Markdown, Markdown Extra (with Table support) and GitHub Flavored Markdown.

With a tabbed document interface, PDF export, a built-in image uploader, session management, spell check, auto-save, syntax highlighting and a built-in CSS management interface, there's no limit to what you can do with MarkdownPad.
